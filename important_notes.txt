107:Landscape uses 1/6th storage of StaticMesh

108: File->Save Level As and type a name to replace the "Minimal_Default" map
When you make map, go to project settings and maps and modes and make sure the "Default Maps" is pointing to the right thing

Manage Landscape: 'Section' is also called 'Component'. X,Y,Z corresponds to a quad measure. Section consists of quads

Upgrade Engine:
Launch and then select which project to open. When selecting, you can choose to say "convert in place".

Adding starter content to project afterwards:
Content Browser->Add New->Add Feature or Content Pack and select starter content

Commenting in BP:
Select the block you want to comment and hit C

Tank: Open mesh of interest(host). Go to Window->Socket Manager and create socket. Attach mesh of interest(parasite) to the socket.Position socket relative to host.
In the BP, add component(Static Mesh) under the host and in the component, attach parent socket to socket created above.

Options to create a gamemodeblueprint to attach a different default pawn:
1) In content browser, C++ classes, Battletank, right click on gamemode and select create blueprint class based on BattleTankGameMode.
2) In Blueprints in the Tab, select World Override, Create and select BattleTankGameMode.

In BluePrint of Tank:
EventGraph is not the only place to add blueprint to manipulate flow. You can create your own graph as well. It is also an eventgraph just that you cannot rename the original event graph
You cannot have begin play in both as it wont know where to start.

BluePrint of MainMenu:
Canvas, Scale, Button, TextBox. Selecting 'isvariable' implies it is interactive so for a click button we want to select it.
for a background image, static it does not have to be variable.


The AimPoint Player UI is referenced in the BP of TankPlayerController. 
The MainMenu UI is referenced in the level blueprint of MainMenu

Game Mode BP -> TankPlayerControllerBP parented to TankPlayerController C++ class
TankBP parented to Tank C++ class
TankBP linked to AI Controller which is TankAIController C++ class

TankAIController gets access to player tank through world get first player controller get controlled tank.
Uses that to aim its own tank towards that location.

Tank creates default subobject for Aiming component in its constructor to create component. it is added as protected because UPROPERTY
cannot allow private

Aiming component contains barrel component. What type is barrel. See BP. It says staticmeshcomponent.
Look in class viewer for staticmeshcomponent. It ultimately comes of UActorComponent which inherits from UObject.
So it is USTaticMeshComponent. 
Tank contains the aiming component.
Barrel is set via Tank BP using a UFUNCTION and this barrel is passed onto the aiming component which sets the barrel it contains

A barrel class is needed in order to create params specific to the barrel such as elevation speed, etc. Don't want to have
all of that in aiming component itself.

TankAimingComponent ticks, TankController ticks.
Why aiming component ticks is because if hit location in world is fixed but player is moving, then barrel needs to move
accordingly. That's why!
